# MindForge

Welcome to **MindForge**, my submission for the Hack Club *Summer of Making*!  

This project started with a simple idea:  
*What if studying math felt less like a chore and more like a game(like some other apps do)*

I wanted to build something that didn't just *track* progress, but something that would actually make me *want* to track it. Something that could turn long boring study sessions and problem sets that are hard into a fun game.

**MindForge** is the result of that idea! A type of study buddy that gamifies the learning process with XP, coins, quests, and AI-powered feedback.


##  The Big Idea

At its core, MindForge follows a simple but powerful and fun loop:

**Studyâ†’ Log â†’ Grow**  

- **Do the Work**  
  Have a study session. Fill a page with notes, solve a dozen problems, or finally understand that tricky concept.

- **Log Your Effort**  
  Instead of just closing your notebook, open MindForge. You can quickly jot down what you did, or even better, take a photo of your notes and upload it.  

- **Get Rewarded & Gain Insight**  
  MindForgeâ€™s AI analyzes your effort and rewards you with XP and Coins. Over time, the app builds a picture of your study habits, showing you where you shine and where you can level up.  

  That "I'm finally done" feeling becomes: 
  **"Look what I've accomplished and how far I've got."**

  ##  Features  

  Here's what MindForge does:

  - **Gamified Economy**  
  Earn XP and Coins for every study session.  

- **AI-Powered Analysis**  
  - *Text Analysis*: Describe your study session, and the AI gives fair XP.  
  - *Image Analysis (GPT-4o Vision)*: Upload a photo of your work â€” the AI analyzes density & difficulty to reward you.  

- **Daily Quests & Bounties**  
  Stay motivated with daily challenges and high-risk, high-reward bounties.  

- **In-App Shop**  
  Spend coins on fun items like Double XP Potions or extra tutor messages.  

- **AI Tutor Chatbot**  
  Stuck? Get instant help from an AI tutor powered by GPT-4o.  

- **Polished UX**  
  - Custom *Tactile Monochrome* theme  
  - Light/dark mode toggle  
  - Particle effects, real-time timers, and custom notifications  

- **Data & Insights**  
  - Track progress with beautiful **Chart.js** visualizations  
  - Get personalized study feedback from AI (with smart daily limits to manage API costs)  

- **Fully Responsive**  
  Works well both on desktop and mobile. 

## The Tech I Used

This was a solo full-stack project(well, mostly solo with design suggestions from Aram), and I kept it simple because its what I could do best:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Vercel Serverless Functions (Node.js) 
- **The Brain**: OpenAI API (GPT-4o & GPT-4o-mini)  
- **Data Persistence**: Browser `localStorage`  
- **Visualization**: Chart.js

## How I got here

This project was a deep dive into building a polished, full-stack app from scratch. I learned a *ton* along the way, from designing the UX to wiring up AI analysis. I learned a lot about prompt design, although I have used it before, I have never used it to such a strict extent.

I wanted to give credit to my friend **Aram** because he was the reason the UI came out so clean *. ðŸ™Œ

Thanks for checking out MindForge! I hope that it makes studying feel less like a chore and more like a game that you can play without your parents saying that its a game!
